<div class="poem">
As I lay my head to REST,
I pray my UI will be blessed.
May my code be clean and bright,
and load successfully tonight.
<br>
Carry on, my devious son,
for there'll be peace when you are done.
Lay your weary head to REST,
don't you CRUD no more.

Get my front-end out of its rigid, RESTful cage.
A single endpoint for every field,
a hundred calls to turn a page.
One giant button to make it go,
a button for a hundred things,
What a pain to make it all work,
what a pain to hear it sing.

Oh, for BFF to descend from the skies,
To unify the data right before my eyes.
Just one request to get the view I need,
And bring salvation to my front end's creed.

Don't you CRUD no more.
