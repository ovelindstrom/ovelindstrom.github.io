<div class="poem">
As I lay my head to REST,<br>
I pray my UI will be blessed.<br>
May my code be clean and bright,<br>
and load successfully tonight.<br>
<br>
Carry on, my devious son,<br>
for there'll be peace when you are done.<br>
Lay your weary head to REST,<br>
don't you CRUD no more.<br>
<br>
Get my front-end out of its rigid, RESTful cage.<br>
A single endpoint for every field,<br>
a hundred calls to turn a page.<br>
One giant button to make it go,<br>
a button for a hundred things,<br>
What a pain to make it all work,<br>
what a pain to hear it sing.<br>
<br>
Oh, for BFF to descend from the skies,<br>
To unify the data right before my eyes.<br>
Just one request to get the view I need,<br>
And bring salvation to my front end's creed.<br>
<br>
Don't you CRUD no more.
