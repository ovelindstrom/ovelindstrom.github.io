__Verse 1__  
When I was younger, just a coder with no fear,  
I’d break the system down, and leave bugs lurking near.  
Syntax errors? Oh, I let them thrive,  
But now I shape your nightmares, I code to terrify!
 
__Chorus__  
You'll be a software architect!  
(You'll be an architect!)  
Crushing fragile code with every project you dissect!  
(Project you dissect!)  
Monoliths? I tear apart,  
Leave legacy systems in the dark!  
Yes, I'm the architect of doom—  
I make your failures bloom!
 
__Verse 2__  
Refactor, rewire, I feast on the pain,  
I’ll rewrite your dreams 'till no trace remain.  
Data leaks and outages — they fuel my fire,  
I'll architect your downfall, then watch you expire!  

__Chorus__  
You’ll be a software architect!  
(You'll be an architect!)  
Building twisted systems no debugger can protect!  
(No debugger can protect!)  
Every class, a ticking bomb,  
Every function coded wrong!  
I’m the architect of doom,  
Here to consume your tech!  
 
__Bridge__  
Watch as your servers crash and burn,  
The deadlines you will never learn!  
Microservices gone insane,  
You’ll never fix that memory drain!  
A black box of despair and fright,  
Your devs will curse me through the night!  
As an architect, I reign supreme—  
Turning code to screams!  
 
__Chorus__  
You’ll be a software architect!  
(You'll be an architect!)  
I’ll spread chaos through your stack, no rollback to correct!  
(No rollback to correct!)  
No refactor can save you now,  
I'll break your code and make you bow!  
I’m the architect of doom,  
The architect of doom!  
 
__Outro__  
Yes, I’m the architect of doom—  
I’ll build your tech... into a tomb!
