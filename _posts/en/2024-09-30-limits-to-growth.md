The earth is in one way a closed in biosphere, not that different from the biospheres in a bottle that you create in science class. Unless we get hit by a huge meteor or we refine the space mining as depicted in the 1981 movie Outland where mining is done on a Jupiter moon "sometime in the 21th century", we are pretty much stuck with the resources that we have here on earth.

That is the base of the 1972 report [_The Limits to Growth_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth), where a team of 17 researchers set out to explain why we can't expand beyond the limits of our current resources. The key objective was to influence economic and industrial policies toward a more sustainable lifestyle.
