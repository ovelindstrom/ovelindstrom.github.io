This site is a personal reflection site that contains things that does not really fit at other sites
I am writing for. This is more personal stuff or just things that happens to go through my mind.

Don't take things you read here too serious.

The site is build with [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) and run on GitHub pages.

It uses the [Reverie Theme](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) by Amit Merchant.

Be nice.
